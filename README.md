My poster presentation at American Society for Mass Spectrometry (ASMS) 2020 on detecting kidney cancer with machine learning and urine-based metabolomics

## Introduction
Due to the characteristic asymptomatic progression of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC), an early diagnosis of RCC greatly improves survival. Currently, RCC is detected through cross-sectional imaging, followed by renal mass biopsy, which is invasive and riddled with sampling errors. Hence, there is a critical need for a non-invasive diagnostic assay. RCC is a disease of altered cellular metabolism with the tumor(s) in close proximity to the urine in the kidney suggesting metabolomic profiling would an excellent choice for assay development.
